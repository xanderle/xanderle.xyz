Hi and welcome to the blog!

About 6 months ago I saw that the TLD xyz was made publically available, on sale and xanderle.xyz was there!

So, all excited I bought it, I had grand plans... I was going to write a blog, point at it my home IP and run some services (think Bitwarden, NextCloud, Plex, etc). Everything I used to have with the .me domain that you get from GitHub for free... I'm sure you know the one.

And after almost a year, I still didn't have a blog. The question of what to write about was just too difficult. Even setting up my own self hosted services wasn't possible since I was sat behind Carrier Grade NAT. 

Well I decided my first post is going to be a meta-post, a blog post about the blog.

Currently this page that you're staring at is built with Gatsby. Pages are markdown files which are parsed and then queryable using GraphQL to populate template files.
To be honest, its sleek and I completely understand why so many people love Gatsby (not just the markdown graphql thing)

This project is commited to Github which Netlify hooks into and publishes for me, thank god for free tier.

Now in its current state, it isn't very accessible for on the go editing. As I mentioned one of my wants for this is it to act as a wiki of sorts (more like a personal stash of information)

Given how tightly I am coupled into the Apple Ecosystem I'm thinking something that ties into the notes app and pulls out my notes into markdown to then be converted into HTML.

I think automator on Mac might do the trick...

In addition to this I also intend to add Typescript to the blog, since it makes me hate Javascript slightly less.
